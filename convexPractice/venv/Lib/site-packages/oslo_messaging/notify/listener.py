"""A notification listener is used to process notification messages sent by a
notifier that uses the ``messaging`` driver.

A notification listener subscribes to the topic - and optionally exchange - in
the supplied target.  Notification messages sent by notifier clients to the
target's topic/exchange are received by the listener.

A notification listener exposes a number of endpoints, each of which contain a
set of methods. Each method's name corresponds to a notification's priority.
When a notification is received it is dispatched to the method named like the
notification's priority - e.g. ``info`` notifications are dispatched to the
info() method, etc.

Optionally a notification endpoint can define a NotificationFilter.
Notification messages that do not match the filter's rules will *not* be passed
to the endpoint's methods.

Parameters to endpoint methods are: the request context supplied by the client,
the publisher_id of the notification message, the event_type, the payload and
metadata. The metadata parameter is a mapping containing a unique message_id
and a timestamp.

An endpoint method can explicitly return
oslo_messaging.NotificationResult.HANDLED to acknowledge a message or
oslo_messaging.NotificationResult.REQUEUE to requeue the message. Note that not
all transport drivers implement support for requeueing. In order to use this
feature, applications should assert that the feature is available by passing
allow_requeue=True to get_notification_listener(). If the driver does not
support requeueing, it will raise NotImplementedError at this point.

The message is acknowledged only if all endpoints either return
oslo_messaging.NotificationResult.HANDLED or None.

*NOTE*: If multiple listeners subscribe to the same target, the notification
will be received by only *one* of the listeners. The receiving listener is
selected from the group using a best-effort round-robin algorithm.

This delivery pattern can be altered somewhat by specifying a pool name for the
listener. Listeners with the same pool name behave like a subgroup within the
group of listeners subscribed to the same topic/exchange.  Each subgroup of
listeners will receive a copy of the notification to be consumed by one member
of the subgroup. Therefore, multiple copies of the notification will be
delivered - one to the group of listeners that have no pool name (if they
exist), and one to each subgroup of listeners that share the same pool name.

**NOTE WELL:** This means that the Notifier always publishes notifications to a
non-pooled Listener as well as the pooled Listeners. Therefore any application
that uses listener pools **must have at least one listener that consumes from
the non-pooled queue** (i.e. one or more listeners that do not set the *pool*
parameter.

Note that not all transport drivers have implemented support for listener
pools. Those drivers that do not support pools will raise a NotImplementedError
if a pool name is specified to get_notification_listener().

Each notification listener is associated with an executor which controls how
incoming notification messages will be received and dispatched. Refer to the
Executor documentation for descriptions of the other types of executors.

*Note:* If the "eventlet" executor is used, the threading and time library need
to be monkeypatched.

Notification listener have start(), stop() and wait() messages to begin
handling requests, stop handling requests, and wait for all in-process
requests to complete after the listener has been stopped.

To create a notification listener, you supply a transport, list of targets and
a list of endpoints.

A transport can be obtained simply by calling the get_notification_transport()
method::

    transport = messaging.get_notification_transport(conf)

which will load the appropriate transport driver according to the user's
messaging configuration. See get_notification_transport() for more details.

A simple example of a notification listener with multiple endpoints might be::

    from oslo_config import cfg
    import oslo_messaging


    class NotificationEndpoint(object):
        filter_rule = oslo_messaging.NotificationFilter(
            publisher_id='^compute.*')

        def warn(self, ctxt, publisher_id, event_type, payload, metadata):
            do_something(payload)


    class ErrorEndpoint(object):
        filter_rule = oslo_messaging.NotificationFilter(
            event_type='^instance\..*\.start$',
            context={'ctxt_key': 'regexp'})

        def error(self, ctxt, publisher_id, event_type, payload, metadata):
            do_something(payload)

    transport = oslo_messaging.get_notification_transport(cfg.CONF)
    targets = [
        oslo_messaging.Target(topic='notifications'),
        oslo_messaging.Target(topic='notifications_bis')
    ]
    endpoints = [
        NotificationEndpoint(),
        ErrorEndpoint(),
    ]
    pool = "listener-workers"
    server = oslo_messaging.get_notification_listener(transport, targets,
                                                      endpoints, pool=pool)
    server.start()
    server.wait()


By supplying a serializer object, a listener can deserialize a request context
and arguments from primitive types.
