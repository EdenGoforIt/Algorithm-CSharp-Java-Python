        This method is used by the RPC client when sending RPC requests to a

        The driver must use the *topic*, *exchange*, and *server* (if present)
        attributes of the *target* to construct the backend-native message
        address. The message address must match the format used by
        subscription(s) created by the :py:meth:`BaseDriver.listen` method.

        If the *target's* *fanout* attribute is set, a copy of the message must
        be sent to all subscriptions using the *exchange* and *topic*
        values. If *fanout* is not set, then only one subscriber should receive
        the message.  In the case of multiple subscribers to the same address,
        only one copy of the message is delivered. In this case the driver
        should implement a delivery pattern that distributes messages in a
        balanced fashion across the multiple subscribers.

        This method must block the caller until one of the following events
        occur:

        * the send operation completes successfully
        * *timeout* seconds elapse (if specified)
        * *retry* count is reached (if specified)

        The *wait_for_reply* parameter determines whether or not the caller
        expects a response to the RPC request. If True, this method must block
        until a response message is received.  This method then returns the
        response message to the caller.  The driver must implement a mechanism
        for routing incoming responses back to their corresponding send
        request. How this is done may vary based on the type of messaging
        backend, but typically it involves having the driver create an internal
        subscription for reply messages and setting the request message's
        *reply-to* header to the subscription address.  The driver may also
        need to supply a correlation identifier for mapping the response back
        to the sender.  See :py:meth:`RpcIncomingMessage.reply`

        If *wait_for_reply* is False this method will block until the message
        has been handed off to the backend - there is no need to confirm that
        the message has been delivered. Once the handoff completes this method
        returns.

        The driver may attempt to retry sending the message should a
        recoverable error occur that prevents the message from being passed to
        the backend. The *retry* parameter specifies how many attempts to
        re-send the message the driver may make before raising a
        :py:exc:`MessageDeliveryFailure` exception. A value of None or -1 means
        unlimited retries. 0 means no retry is attempted. N means attempt at

        Notifications use a *store and forward* delivery pattern. The driver

        message has or will be processed by the intended recipient.

        The driver must use the *topic* and *exchange* attributes of the

        same address. In this case the driver should implement a delivery
        pattern that distributes messages in a balanced fashion across the

        There is an exception to the single delivery semantics described above:

        tuples of (target, priority) addresses.

        The driver must create a subscription for each (*target*, *priority*)
        pair. The topic for the subscription is created for each pair using the
        format `"%s.%s" % (target.topic, priority)`.  This format is used by
        the caller of the :py:meth:`BaseDriver.send_notification` when setting
        the topic member of the target parameter.

        Only the *exchange* and *topic* must be considered when creating
        subscriptions. *server* and *fanout* must be ignored.

        The *pool* parameter, if specified, should cause the driver to create a
        subscription that is shared with other subscribers using the same pool
        identifier. Each pool gets a single copy of the message. For example if
        there is a subscriber pool with identifier **foo** and another pool
        **bar**, then one **foo** subscriber and one **bar** subscriber will
        each receive a copy of the message.  The driver should implement a
        delivery pattern that distributes message in a balanced fashion across
        the subscribers in a pool.

        The driver must raise a :py:exc:`NotImplementedError` if pooling is not
        supported and a pool identifier is passed in.

        Refer to the description of :py:meth:`BaseDriver.send_notification` for
        further details regarding implementation.
